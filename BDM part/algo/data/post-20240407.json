PRICE/VALUE RATIO is unbeatable. All we needed was a nice, clean, safe place with breakfast. We have been spending whole day in the city so distance was not a problem either.",

Sara is so friendly and nice! She speaks english fluently...helped alot with places to go...and advices for trips... The hostel is abit far from city centre...but the metro station is very near to the hostel...around 5 min away...metro took around 30 minutes to reach central metro station for switching trains...early departure from hostel and starting your day early would cause no problem to your schedule at all... There is washing machine and dryer and iron and lockers... Overall this is an excellent hostel!

I recommend that you take the breakfast pack because you&#39;ll end up much cheaper than just paying there for it. The hotel is close to whatever you want to visit. Just take the subway and you are there. It&#39;s close to the Avenida Diagonal street and from there you can visit La Pedrera and other sites. Breakfast is diverse and delicious. Oh! Not to forget about the staff. They are very helpful. Whatever information you might need just ask and they will help. They also have tickets at the hotel for the main attractions. so if you by from the hotel you don&#39;t have to wait in line for buying one. We thought it&#39;s not necessary when we went to teh Sagrada Famillia and we ended up staying about 15 minutes on the line. I thought Barcelona would be more spectacular, but it wasn&#39;t. So I would come back to Barcelona only to see what I&#39;ve missed and I would defenely stay at Aparthotel Mariano Cubi. It&#39;s in the city center, but on a quite street. By the way, the rooms are exactly what you see in the pics. Great, great hotel!",

Besides that, the hotel is very well located, close to the amazing Sagrada Familia, to the public transportation, charming bakeries, cafes, fruit stores, and restaurants. There&#39;s something I will never forget abou my stay: at the airport, due to the aerial chaos, I was told I couldn&#39;t fly to Paris with my family as I had planned and then called to the hotel to check if we could return. They said they had no availability anymore but made arrangements for us to stay in a partner hotel. Among so much stress and disappointment with the unpredictible situation their help was fundamental; at that point finding a hotel in Barcelona seemed impossible. I am so thankful for all they did for me and my family. I strongly recommend this hotel and also their parter, Wilson Hotel, at Diagonal Ave.",

Location was great - about a 10-15 minute walk to the top of the Ramblas, Girona Metro stop 1.5 blocks away. Neighborhood felt safe, even late at night, and the hotel seemed extremely secure. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful, providing recommendations, directions, etc. They are also excellent English-speakers. 1 computer with free internet access and a nice little 2nd-floor sunning deck were nice touches as well. A word of warning to anyone visiting Barcelona - wear a money belt. I was pick-pocketed in the Verdaguer Metro station on my way from the Sants train station to the hotel, probably 10 minutes in to my visit.

The hotel is conveniently located near Passeig de Gracia station, where there are 3 major subway lines and the airport train R2 comes here as well. We walked to Sagra Familia, Las Ramblas, La Boqueria Market and Catalunya Plaza.The hotel has a tiny pool but it doesn&#39;t really do much. The terrace is a nice hangout spot though. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend staying at Euro-Park if you are looking for a good value hotel.",

I stayed in the hostel for a week when I moved to Barcelona and was looking for somewhere to live and they couldn&#39;t have been more helpful. LOVE IT",
